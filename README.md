# SeqGraph

SeqGraph (sequential graphics) is a small graphics API built in pure C. Its only dependency is [libosw](https://github.com/fadedled/libosw). 

# Build in linux
Clone the repository and run the `initializa.sh` script. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiltMont/SeqGraph
cd SeqGraph
chmod +x initialize.sh
./initialize.sh
```

then you can do `make test`.
